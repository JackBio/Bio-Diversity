# Bio-Diversity

This project is my first sci (if it could be publicized), about environmental factors and microorganisms diversity. Most of them are R codes but maybe some '.sh' files. 

Those scripts include relationship, niche, alpha-beta diversity, and so on. Most of them are modefied from public web source, so maybe little innovation...

<All the codes or notes has one backup in private MacBookPro "生信/脚本" and the other one in disk>

《是的，第一次写代码，第一次读研，第一次写sci，我是真的菜，有什么问题欢迎一起讨论。但愿这篇文章能发，但愿能读博》
